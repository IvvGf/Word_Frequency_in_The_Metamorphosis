# Word Frequency in The Metamorphosis

## Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze the frequency of words in Franz Kafka's novel "The Metamorphosis". By identifying the most common words and their distribution, the analysis aimed to provide insights into the text's structure and thematic elements.

## Context
_"The Metamorphosis"_, written by Franz Kafka, is a cornerstone of modernist literature. Understanding the frequency and context of words within this text can offer a deeper comprehension of its themes and narrative style. This project leverages text processing and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze the content of the novel. The full text of the work was obtained from the library available at Project Gutenberg.

## Duration
The analysis was conducted over several days, involving stages of web scraping, text preprocessing, word frequency analysis, and visualization.

## Role
As the project's data analyst, I led the process of extracting the text from the web, cleaning and processing the data, conducting the word frequency analysis, and creating visualizations to present the findings.

## Tools and Methodologies
- **_Python:_** Used for web scraping, data manipulation, and analysis.
- **_Libraries:_** requests, BeautifulSoup, nltk, Counter, pandas, and plotly.
- **_Techniques:_** Text tokenization, stopword removal, word frequency counting, and data visualization.
